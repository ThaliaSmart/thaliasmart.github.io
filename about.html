		<p> The creators of this website are Paris, Thalia, and Aiyanna. This website is their final project for the Girls Who Code summer program at AIG. As young women who wear their hair in its natural state, they noted that a big issue within the natural community was that resources were not centralized. This meant that in order to find the articles, products, and tips they needed, they had to navigate throughout the entirety of the maze-like jungle that is the internet. They decided to change that. This website is a culmination of the valuable skills that they each possess, as well as a demonstration of their ability to work well in a collaborative environment. </p>
