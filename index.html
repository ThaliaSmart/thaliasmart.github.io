	<p id="firstp">
	My name is Thalia Smart. I am entering my senior year of highschool at Curtis in Staten Island New York.
	</p>
	<p id="secondp">
	I am 17 years old with many different aspirations in life. I hope to either become a lawyer or a journalist.
	</p>
	<p id="thirdp">
	I am also patient about soccer and rugby and happen to be captain of both sports teams at my school.
	</p>
	<p id="fifthp">
	On my spare time I enjoy to shop and hang out with my friends as well as spending time with my family.
	</p>
	<p id="sixthp">
	Now that I am entering my senior year I feel a bit overwhelmed with college applications and essays.
	</p>
	<p id="seventhp">
	Other than all the stress I am excited for my last year in highschool and going to cherish every moment.
